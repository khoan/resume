<h4 id="responsibilities-6">Responsibilities:</h4>

<h5 id="guaranteed-top-spot-gts">Guaranteed Top Spot (GTS)</h5>

<p>GTS secures 4 prominent slots where clients can book to have their listings appear before all organic search results.

<p>The system was built for the Realestate Institute of Victoria’s homepage to display chosen listings from realestateVIEW’s database as Property of the Week. When more than one property is chosen, the display will rotate through the listings. When a listing is sold, hidden or removed, the system randomly substitutes another listing in place and emails an alert to the Institute.

<ul>
